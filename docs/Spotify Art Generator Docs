This project has a user log into their Spotify account, and it displays all their playlists for them on a dashboard once logged in. They can then select any of their playlists to generate a playlist cover for using AI-generated Art. If the user does not like the first image, they can keep clicking to generate new images, and the project also stores all previously generated images for that specific playlist as well, so the user can always go back to them.
