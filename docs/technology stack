We considered using Firebase and MongoDB for our backend and ended up using 
Firebase backend to store all generated images per Spotify user. 
Firebase is a backend-as-a-service platform 
that provides real-time databases, authentication, hosting, storage and more. 
MongoDB is a document based NoSQL database 
designed for handling unstructured data. 
We decided to use Firebase because it is conveneint to run things quickly 
wihtout having to worry about setting up multiple services. 
Also, Firebase's real-time database feature is designed for real time synchronization 
of data between devices. 
While MongoDB can be used for real time applications as well, 
it may require additional setup and configuration. 
Once we had a clear understanding of our project idea and requirements, 
we evaluated Firebase's real-time database feature as well as its APIs. 
Firebase provides a range of APIs for integrating with the front-end framework we used 
which was React. 
Choosing Firebase helped us save development time and effort.
