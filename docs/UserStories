Gen Art User Story
    Once user has logged in, linked a Spotify account, and selected a playlist, the user will be presented with
    the option to generate art for that selected playlist based on sentiment and mood that will be gathered from
    the Spotify API. They will have options to generate art based off any number of tracks from the playlist or entire
    playlist. The process will be to press a button to generate the playlist art picture. When everything
    goes right, the server should send a picture to the client and their screen will update with a potential
    picture that they may choose to download, or there will be another button to regenerate a new picture. Once
    the new picture is regenerated, it will appear on their screen again. If something were to go wrong, the client
    would be presented with an error screen and should be prompted to reselect the playlist and try again.


Download Art User Story
    Once the user has logged in, linked a Spotify account, selected a playlist, and generated satisfactory art
    for that playlist, the user will have the option to save and download the generated art as a file stored
    locally. There will be a button to click if they want to download and it will prompt them with a screen
    asking which file format they would like, name of picture, and where they would like to download the file 
    locally (e.g. download as a .png file to desktop or as .jpeg file to downloads folder). If everything goes
    right, it will download into the desired location in the desired format. If the download were to go wrong, it
    will prompt the user with an error message and tell them to please wait and try again.
