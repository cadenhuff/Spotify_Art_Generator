User Login User Story:
    As a user, I want to log in to my Spotify account through the app, so that I can view and analyze my playlists. 
    If the login fails due to incorrect credentials, I want to be informed of the error and given the option to try 
    again or recover my account. The sign in page asks for my Spotify username and password and gives me the ability 
    to reset my password if I forget it by sending me an email to reset password. The Spotify create an account page
    asks for my email, a username and a password. When creating my account, if my email or username is already in 
    use, I will be unable to create an account and notified.

  
Spotify User Dashboard Story:
    As a user, I want to view a list of all my playlists with a display for each Playlist Name, Playlist Cover, Playlist
    Sentiment Analysis, and the first five songs in each playlist, so that I can quickly see which playlists I might 
    want to listen to depending on my current mood. If there is an error in loading my playlists, I want to be informed
    of the error and given the option to refresh the page or try again later.


Select Playlist User Story:
    As a user, I want to be able to log into my Spotify account and see all of my playlists displayed on the dashboard. 
    From there, I want to be able to easily select a specific playlist that I would like to generate artwork for. 
    In the event that the selection process doesn't redirect me properly, I would like to see a clear error message 
    that prompts me to try again or pick a different playlist. If I accidentally select the wrong playlist, I would 
    like to be able to navigate back to the dashboard and choose a new one without any issues.


Generating Art User Story
    As a user, once I have logged into my Spotify account and selected a playlist, I should be able to generate art 
    for that selected playlist based on its sentiment and mood gathered from the playlist's audio features. I can 
    generate art as many times as I desire by pressing a button. If everything goes right, the server should send a 
    picture to my screen and update it with a potential picture that I can choose to download by double-clicking it 
    and clicking "Save Image As", or I can regenerate a new picture by pressing another button. Whenever a new 
    picture is regenerated, it should appear on my screen again. If something were to go wrong, an error screen 
    will be presented to me, and I will be prompted to reselect the playlist and try again.


Previously Generated Art User Story
    As a user, I want to be able to view all previously generated art pieces for each playlist at the bottom of the 
    selected playlist's page. After I have generated a piece of artwork for a playlist, I should be able to see it again 
    at any time in the future. When I navigate to the selected playlist's page, I should see a section at the bottom of 
    the page that displays all of the previously generated art pieces for that playlist. If there are too many art pieces 
    to display at once, I should be able to scroll through them using a scrollbar or pagination. If for any reason I am 
    not able to view all previously generated art pieces for a playlist, I should see an error message and be prompted 
    to try again later.
